The sol2 header for Lua integration uses the C++14 standard and depends upon
Boost. This means that when building Boost with b2, pass the cxxstd=14 flag
so that the C++14 versions of the libraries are built. All other code must also
be C++14 conformant (the flag is set at the top of FindLibs.cmake).

Installing Cliniface on Linux as an AppImage can be a headache. Here are some
of the issues and resolutions I have encountered:

1) On Ubuntu Xenial, the runpath of IDTFConverter and its shared libraries
may need to be explicitly set to $ORIGIN (i.e. the location of the ELF).
The current u3dIntel.tgz has correctly patched ELFs built under Xenial, so
this shouldn't be a problem anymore.

2) The linuxdeployqt app has a couple of issues (I think). Firstly, you can't
exclude libraries, which you will need to do because in the Qt plugins folder,
all of the sqldrivers except the one for sqllite rely on older libaries which
aren't available as part of the base packages for the distribution (and
anyway, they're not needed).

The linuxdeployqt app seems to not only look in the plugins folder for files,
but also uses the CMake files to check for the presence of the files. So right
now, the Qt CMake files for the SQL plugins I don't need have the respective
lines commented out. It's only three files:
Qt/5.12.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Sql/Qt5Sql_QMYSQLDriverPlugin.cmake
Qt/5.12.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Sql/Qt5Sql_QODBCDriverPlugin.cmake
Qt/5.12.3/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5Sql/Qt5Sql_QPSQLDriverPlugin.cmake

In all three files, all lines are commented out.
Also remove the respective files from the plugins/sqldrivers directory.

3) When running the finished AppImage, it has said that libQt5X11Extras.so
couldn't be found. Which is weird because the runpath for cliniface is set to
the libs directory where that file is contained. To check this, run:

readelf -d cliniface

To fix , use patchelf to set that library as NEEDED in cliniface:

patchelf --add-needed "libQt5X11Extras.so" cliniface

4) For some reason the permissions are not set properly causing the Travis CI
automated check to fail (unable to mount the filesystem). This may or may not
be an issue for other users, but to fix, set permissions correctly on the AppDir:

chmod -Rv 755 AppDir
