Cliniface is a desktop application for the visualisation and analysis of 3D images of faces.
It is primarily aimed at medical clinicians (particularly diagnosticians) to assist in the
practice of clinical facial morphometrics (deriving measurements of clinical utility about
the shape and surface of the face).

The other users being targetted are those people working in the field of 3D facial analysis
and visualisation. The application offers functionality that can assist in the
researcher's workflow such as cleaning and modifying the face model (primarily hole filling, 
smoothing, cropping, and translating). In addition, the application can be extended using
plugins to provide new features and functions developed by the researcher
(see [FaceTools](../../../FaceTools)).

Further documentation is still being developed. Stay tuned!
