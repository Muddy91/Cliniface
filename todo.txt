*************** BUGS ***************
1) Crash on remesh --> hole fill --> remesh (reproduce on Max Baynam).
2) Occasional hang on hole fill (see IGF2 Picture 1)
3) Fix creation / I/O of orientation data (always calculate from landmarks?)
4) Path caption line visible when path editor enabled and no paths present.
5) Remeshed polygons have alternately incorrect normals (problem seen with backface culling enabled).



************* FEATURES *************

Actions Framework:
- Asynchronous actions - protect shared data.
- Actions specify what other kinds of actions (ChangeEvent based) they should disable before running?

Interaction:
- Interactors stack (QTools)
- Dropdown lists to aid model selection ??

Landmarks:
- Different colours for landmarks between faces.
- Dialog, action, etc (need rename also)
- Make face landmark detection points non-deletable.

Notes:
- Dialog, action, etc

Measures:
- Dialog, action, etc
- Geodesic distances for calipers tool.
- Option to draw selectable lines between face landmark detection points.
- Optional caliper handle size.
- Angles between points.

Features:
- Extract & visualise FASD:
    - Palpebral Fissure Length (PFL)
    - Philtrum
    - Upper lip

Transform Menu:
Rotate 90 degrees about three different axis

Tools:
- Align CPD
- Change ICP align to use common landmarks on selected model (and radius?).
- Export PDF
- Selection tool with dragable boundary.
- Fix hole filling so doesn't generate non-flat vertices requiring subsequent clean.
- Include move/copy actions on context menu.
- Undo/redo for landmark movement, other edits etc.
- Progress bar values.
- Show line paths as A*path or geodesics.
- Check/download updates in Help menu.
- Localised smoothing (use radial select tool)?

Visualisations:
- Asymmetric colour mapping with vertical pencil at nose-tip.
- Toggle show legend (for supported visualisations).
- Option to toggle on/off legends on individual viewers.
- Restore legends if moved outside viewer.

Reporting:
- Z-scores for relevent HPO terms.

Documentation:
- Documentation accessible via link to GitHub website.

Errors:
- Logging to file (dialog offering to send log as email attachment?)

I/O:


Previous/other (may not be an issue anymore):
- Prevent VTK error dialog from appearing on release build.
- Landmarks dialog column spacing.
- Show toggle for single landmarks not working.
- Extremely minor texture mapping inaccuracies after subdivision.
