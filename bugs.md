2. Occasional hang on hole fill (see IGF2 Picture 1)
3. Fix creation / I/O of orientation data (always calculate from landmarks?)
4. Path caption line visible when path editor enabled and no paths present.
5. Remeshed polygons have alternately incorrect normals (problem seen with backface culling enabled).
