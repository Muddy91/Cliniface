0. When copying/moving across a view, need to ensure consistency of visualisation layers as per their application spec.
1. Copying when radial select visualisation active doesn't apply visualisation correctly.
2. PDF report camera placement doesn't reflect viewer placement.
3. Fix hole filling so doesn't generate non-flat vertices requiring subsequent clean.
4. Regularize progression of progress bar across actions that use it.
5. Restore legends if moved outside viewer.
6. Fill holes infinite loop (see fillholes_bug0.obj).
7. QKeySequence key shortcuts not working.
