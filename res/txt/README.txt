The Cliniface application provides a suite of tools and visualisation
technologies to support the analysis and processing of 3D facial images
from a wide variety of file formats. The program supports concurrent
viewing of different face models in three adjacent view panes. Face
models can be superimposed upon one another and different visualisations
selected to inform the user of the salient aspects of facial morphology.
Automatic face detection and surface correspondence tools, along with
data cleaning functions such as cropping, smoothing, and resampling can
assist in comparing data coming from different sources. Characteristic
landmarks can be automatically mapped and/or manually edited, and
distance measurements can be taken between pairs of points on the face.
The model data are saved within a single file that archives together
both the model data stored a standard format (Wavefront OBJ) and the
meta-data extracted by Cliniface.

Cliniface has been designed around a plugin architecture to support the
extension and integration of functionality developed by third-parties.
This provides researchers and programmers working with 3D facial images
the means to rapidly develop, test, and deploy new features within
Cliniface as modular separately compiled plugins - leveraging
Cliniface's existing capabilities without needing to develop specialised
visualisation and I/O routines. If suitable, these plugins can be made
available to other users of Cliniface giving them rapid access to
state-of-the-art algorithms and new features. Developing plugins for
Cliniface offers an efficient pathway for the rapid exposure and uptake
of research outputs within both industry and research.
