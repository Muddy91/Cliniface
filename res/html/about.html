<p>The Cliniface application provides a suite of tools and visualisation technologies to support the analysis and processing of 3D facial images from a wide variety of file formats. The program supports concurrent viewing of different face models in three adjacent view panes. Face models can be superimposed upon one another and different visualisations selected to inform the user of the salient aspects of facial morphology. Automatic face detection and surface correspondence tools, along with data cleaning functions such as cropping, smoothing, and resampling can assist in comparing data coming from different sources. Characteristic landmarks can be automatically mapped and/or manually edited, and distance measurements can be taken between pairs of points on the face. The model data are saved within a single file that archives together both the model data stored a standard format (Wavefront OBJ) and the meta-data extracted by Cliniface.</p>
<p>Cliniface has been designed around a plugin architecture to support the extension and integration of functionality developed by third-parties. This provides researchers and programmers working with 3D facial images the means to rapidly develop, test, and deploy new features within Cliniface as modular separately compiled plugins - leveraging Cliniface's existing capabilities without needing to develop specialised visualisation and I/O routines. If suitable, these plugins can be made available to other users of Cliniface giving them rapid access to state-of-the-art algorithms and new features. Developing plugins for Cliniface offers an efficient pathway for the rapid exposure and uptake of research outputs within both industry and research.</p>
