3.2.0
1. pdflatex doesn't run if installed in system dir (permissions?)
2. Backface culling not always applied after move/copy or load.
3. When merging view from centre to left/right AND no other views in centre, then remove view to centre and close left/right viewer.
4. Need orientation to always be updated automatically after salient landmarks change!
5. Cannot close model if locked (e.g. due to surface curvature calculation).
6. Placement of elements on FASD reports in printed version not as designed in LaTeX!

3.1.0
1. Copying when radial select visualisation active doesn't apply visualisation correctly.
2. Hole filling generates non-flat vertices requiring subsequent clean.
3. Regularize progression of progress bar across actions that use it.
4. Restore legends if moved outside viewer.
5. Fill holes infinite loop (see fillholes_bug0.obj).
6. QKeySequence key shortcuts not working.
7. Ensure path label removed on deletion of path.
