1. Copying when radial select visualisation active doesn't apply visualisation correctly.
2. PDF report camera placement doesn't reflect viewer placement.
3. Fix hole filling so doesn't generate non-flat vertices requiring subsequent clean.
4. Regularize progression of progress bar across actions that use it.
5. Restore legends if moved outside viewer.
6. Fill holes infinite loop (see fillholes_bug0.obj).
7. QKeySequence key shortcuts not working.
8. Ensure path label removed on deletion of path.
9. Metric caption (bottom left) disappearing when moving between landmarks and metric visualisations.
10. After closing metrics dialog (but with metrics visible), prevent reopening of the dialog upon moving landmarks.
